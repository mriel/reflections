When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository if you are collaborating with people. Especially if the person is far away in a different
state or a different country.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to add public changes to a respository. You might not always want to update the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks would be used if I want to clone a repository from another user and collaborate with another user without harming the original. Clones are for local use to experiment without harming the original.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefits of having a copy from the last know state is having the ability to work offline then merging with online remote when you can.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be a lot easier collaborating with github. It would be initially hard to learn git and github if you are using a different version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you needed to be offline or when you want to experiment on some changes.
